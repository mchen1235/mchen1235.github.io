		<h2>Reflection</h2>
			<p>The most trouble during this project came from learning how to use github through git. Git is new to me so I had to look up a few commands to make sure everything was commited correctly. It was not as bad as it could have been since I did the get it tutorial before starting this assignment. During this assignment I learned how to use Git as previously explained a couple sentences ago. I also learned how to write html since I basically forgot how it worked. Relearning it was easy because I already took a class in it which was about 5 months long and it covered concepts slightly more complex. The main resourses I used included the git it practice and the assigned readings from the course website. Git it was helpful for learning git and a little bit of github. The readings were helpful for reviewing html.</p>
