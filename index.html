		<h2>Questions for the Student</h2>
		<h3>What is the most complex thing you've done with your current web development skills</h3>
			<p>
			The most complex thing I have done with my web development skills is making a simple website with multiple links. The only time I have done web development was in 10th grade when I took a class called web design. It was fairly simple and did not go too in depth into web design. I believe it was taught in html since the code I am currently writing seems exactly like what I did in that class.

		<h3>What do you hope to learn and have you joined Piazza</h3>
			<p>
			During this class, I hope to learn about different features that can be added to make a web page more fancy. The only projects I have done were like this assignment, so I think it would be fun to spice up a web page with unique additions. I have signed up for piazza

		<h3>A description of the most interesting fact about you or the most unique experience you've had</h3>
			<p>
			I once had a project about existentialism. Since we were allowed to turn anything in as long as it represented this topic, I baked a cake. It ended up having dark colors for the frosting and no taste at all. It also had awkward looking shapes stacked on top of each other. I enjoy baking and I thought that it would be interesting to give my teacher a cake as my submission. I am just glad that the cake never molded while it was sitting in the classroom for a weekend. I probably should have thought about that beforehand.
